/*			A NOTE TO THE MARKER:
				I *may* have gone a *little* overboard on this assignment... I have therefore
				made use of a header file and functions definitions files (and plenty of comments
				next to function prototypes) in an attempt to make this a little bit easier to 
				mark. 
				
				Function definitions files are grouped into 3 categories:
					1) Anything that fetches or checks user input
					2) Anything whose primary function is to print to the console
					3) Any functions which serve to perform either:
							a) "behind-the-scenes" calculations	/ functions			--OR--
							b) write-to-file functions											
				
				I did stray from these categories mildly in an attempt to create an even easier
				to follow organization (for example, calcHist and DispHist are right next to 
				eachother in console_output.cpp - rather than putting calcHist in "rollDice_and_fileIO".

				The adjustments I made to the program were with Dr. Sabouni's express consent.
				If you're interested in confirming, see the Assignment 7 discussion board on Bsp.
				
				Hope you enjoy marking as much as I enjoyed creating!											*/
